Returns the schema of the Events endpoint

# Format

The query can be answered in XML and JSON formats.

The default response format is JSON, and is compliant with JSON Schema, with a few additions.

# Input

The schema may vary depending on the following input:

* assay_name
* locale

The _assay_name_ may specify different fields or different values for a _condition_ field, for example.

The _locale_ will determine the language of the labels, detailed in the _values_ section of the enum fields.

# Response

The response will include a list of the supported fields with the details of each one.

{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  "title": "MTB_RIF.es_AR",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "result_group": {...},
    "patient_location": {...},
    "age": {...},
    ...
  },
  "required": ["result_group"]
}

## Enum

For the Enum fields we added an extra _values_ field that will include one of the following:

* uri of the metadata
* a metadata dictionary

### Metadata Schema

When the value provides a uri, the endpoint will provide the values according to the following schema:

`{
  “title”: “Results”,
  “additionalProperties”: {
    “title”: “Result”,
    “type”: “object”,
    “properties”: {
      “name”: { “type”: “string” },
      “kind”: { “type”: “string”, “enum”: [“positive”, “negative”, “error”] }
    },
    “required”: [“name”, “kind”]
  }
}`

In the case of results, the _values_ metadata will include a _name_ or localized label, and a _kind_ that will categorize the result positivity in 3 possible values: positive, negative, or error.

Other enumerations will include different properties, or the implementation may define _"additionalProperties": true_ to allow dynamic injection of properties.

`{
  “title”: "Conditions",
  “additionalProperties”: {
    “title”: “Condition”,
    “type”: “object”,
    “properties”: {
      “name”: { “type”: “string” }
    },
    "additionalProperties" : true,
    “required”: [“name”]
  }
}`

In any case, to obtain the schema of a given endpoint, the uri will be the same as the endpoint with an additional `/schema[.format]`

#### Example

`"result_group": {
  "title": "Result"
  "description": "Grouped result",
  "type": "string",
  "enum": ["pos_with_RIF", "negative"],
  "values": "http//example.com/values"
}`

In this case, the endpoint "http//example.com/values" will provide the possible values, and the endpoint "http//example.com/values/schema.json" will provide the schema of such values.

### Metadata Dictionary

The "values" field will include the metadata inlined inside the definition.

`"result_group": {
  "title": "Result"
  "description": "Grouped result",
  "type": "string",
  "enum": ["pos_with_RIF", "negative"],
  "values": {
    "pos_with_RIF": {"name": "MTB Detected", "kind": "positive"},
    "negative": {"name": "Negative", "kind": "negative"}
  }
}`


The inlined values must follow the default values schema. If a different implementation is needed, it can only be provided with the external uri and schema.

## Location

The location fields, such as the laboratory location or the patient location, will include an extra "locations" field. This field can contain a uri of the locations provider, or it can contain the inlined locations.

### Locations Schema

`{
  “title”: “Location hierarchies”,
  “additionalProperties”: {
    “title”: “Location hierarchy”,
    “type”: “object”,
    “properties”: {
      “name”: { “type”: “string” },
      “lat”: { “type”: “float” },
      “lng”: { “type”: “float” },
      “level”: { “type”: “integer” },
      “boundary”: { “type”: “uri” },
      “parent_id”: { “type”: “string” },
      “geoids”: {
        "additionalProperties": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      }
    },
    “required”: [“name”]
  }
}`

#### Example

`"patient_location": {
  "title": "Patient Location",
  "description": "Location of the patient",
  "type": "string",
  “locations”: “uri”
}`

### Locations Dictionary

Locations inlined inside the field definition. This will be feasible only for small number of locations, and should be avoided for a hierarchy with over a hundred nodes. The inlined locations must follow the default locations schema. If a different implementation is needed, it can only be provided with the external uri and schema.

#### Example

`"patient_location": {
  "title": "Patient Location",
  "description": "Location of the patient",
  "type": "string",
  "locations": {
    “LOC001”: {
      name: "Argentina",
      lat: -34.6,
      lng: -58.38,
      level: 0,
      boundary: “http://example.com/boundaries.json#LOC001”,
      geoids: { iso_code: "ARG" }
    },
    “LOC002”: {
      name: "Buenos Aires",
      lat: -34.6,
      lng: -58.38,
      level: 1,
      parent_id: "LOC001",
      geoids: { fips_code: "1212" }
    },
    “LOC003”: {
      name: "Chaco",
      lat: -34.6,
      lng: -58.38,
      level: 1,
      parent_id: "LOC001"
    }
  }
}`

## Integer
The integer fields will follow the JSON Schema convention.

For convenience and simplicity, the implementations should avoid the use of "exclusiveMinimum" and "exclusiveMaximum" and asume the defaults.

#### Example

`"age": {
  "title": "Age",
  "type": "integer",
  "minimum": 0,
  "maximum": 199
}`

## Date

The date field has some differences with the specifyed by JSON Schema:

* The full ISO 8601 standard is adopted, not only a subset. This allows the usage of 2014-W34 to report an event that occured in that week if the client has no permission to see the exact date.
* A "resolution" field is added, specifying the maximum level of granularity of the date-time value provided. Possible values are:
  * second
  * minute
  * hour
  * day
  * week
  * month
  * year

For resolution values of second, minute, and hour, a timezone must be included in the date-time value.

#### Example

`"created_at": {
  "title": "Creation date",
  "type": "string",
  "format":"date-time",
  "resolution": "day"
}`
